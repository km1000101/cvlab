## Introduction

This repository includes various projects focused on implementing different computer vision algorithms and techniques. These projects demonstrate the application of edge detection, Gabor filters, frequency domain analysis using Fourier Transform, and more.

## Projects

### Edge Detection

- **Description**: Implements Canny and Laplacian edge detection techniques to identify edges in images.
- **Files**: `edge_detection.ipynb`

### Gabor Filters

- **Description**: Applies Gabor filters to analyze textures in images, highlighting the impact of different filter orientations and frequencies.
- **Files**: `gabor_filters.ipynb`

### Laplacian Edge Detection

- **Description**: Utilizes Laplacian edge detection to emphasize areas of rapid intensity change in images.
- **Files**: `laplacian_edge_detection.ipynb`

### Frequency Domain Analysis

- **Description**: Conducts frequency domain analysis using Fourier Transform to uncover frequency components in images.
- **Files**: `frequency_domain_analysis.ipynb`

### Non-Maximum Suppression

- **Description**: Implements non-maximum suppression to thin out detected edges, preserving only the most significant ones.
- **Files**: `non_maximum_suppression.ipynb`
